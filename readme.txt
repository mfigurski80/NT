ðŸ¦« NT Notion Command Line
=========================

Hello from Notion!
NT is a command-line application to read/parse exposed notion pages into text output on the command line!
	This readme is likely parsed by the tool!

## Usage ##


### Reading Pages ###

You can read a page with the command nt read <pageId>. This will print it to your standard output, which on the command line can be redirected to a file by using nt read <pageId> > <outputFile>.

## Installation ##


### Source Code Installation ###

This is a go project. In order to install, make sure you have the latest version of golang, and then do:
//![code]

### Application Installation ###

There are no currently linked binaries. However, once I get around to that, you should be able to download binaries from the right hand column on the github page, and then simply put them somewhere inside your path (generally ~/.local/bin), and use it anywhere by simply typing nt <command> into your terminal!
