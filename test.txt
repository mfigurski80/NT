	Observation🔭 → Question❓ → Hypothesis❗ → Experiment🧪 → Results📰 → Conclusion😍 → <restart or done>
	
	Any experiment needs:
	- Independent variable — thing you're changing
	- Dependent variable — thing you're measuring
	- Standardized variables — things you're keeping the same across groups
	- Control group — group where the independent variable is unchanged
	- Experimental group — group where independent variable is changed
	After going through an experiment, do some stat! to see if difference is significant
	
	Reporting publishes methods, results, conclusions, and then undergoes peer review: 
	- Peer review promotes rigor & validity, done by experts in the field before publishing
		- Look for errors
		- Accept / revise / reject
		- Not perfect
	- Peer testing happens after publishing
		- People use your methodology to do experiment again (but better)
		- Will probably get you, lets be honest
	- Disclose conflict of interest
	
	[[ 🔥 Consensus in a scientific field can take a while ]]
	
	Consensus: collective agreement of majority of scientists in a particular field of study
	Furthermore, scientists are very poorly connected with the public, who mostly get their understanding from the media or policymakers (think pop sci, etc). Like here: https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/significant.png

	## Biological Sex and Gender ##
	
	Sex is Biological, determined by chromosomes, physical, physiological characteristics
	Gender recently refers to sociological things, and Gender Identity is how you perceive yourself in relation to sociological things
	
	### Cell Theory ###
	
	All have 4 basic features:
	- Membrane
	- Genetic Information
	- Ability to make Proteins
	- Cytosol (fluid space inside cell)
	
	### Human Development ###
	
	Unicellular cells reproduce asexually through cell division, producing exact clones.
	Sexual reproduction uses gametes: sperm + egg = zygote → embryo. Still need to use cell division, but differentiate genetic information.
	Humans have chromosomes, 1-22 (autosomes, not sexual), and two 1 chromosomes (sexual). XX → Female, XY → Male. Females get 1 X deactivated (visible Barr Body dot in cells), and no SRY gene because no Y chromosome, and so WNT4 turned on.
	Before 6 weeks, has BOTH m/f set of structures. After, one set degenerates, and other develops into primary sex characteristic (genitalia).
	Testosterone → ♂️, and Estrogen → ♀️
	
	Puberty: secondary sex characteristics
	Depends on sex hormone concentration, not needed for reproduction.
	Sexual Dimorphism — differences in size or appearance between sexes

	Argument for defining sex as binary (Wright), or Quinn (spectrum)
	
	## Determination in Nature ##
	
	Sex deciding process can fail at many levels:
	- There are many genes involved in the process, any of which can fail. SRY → SOX9 → DMRT1, and !SRY → FOXL2
		- Even in adult mice, FOXL2 needs to be present to maintain ovaries from turning into testes, and DMRT1 maintains testes to suppress ovaries
	- Mutations can lead to intersex individuals, even if not on sex chromosomes themselves
	Sex can be fluid, determined in different ways by different species. Plants are often hermaphroditic — make pollen and seeds, make female and male flower
	Some species can turn on / off genes like DMRT1 and FOXL2 (common to vertebrates) to change genders
	
	2021-09-13 →  
	
	## Sex Roles in Nature ##
	
	Eggs — Big cells, 300-400 over lifetime. Invests more in the gamete. "Nutritious" ~ Prof Nam
	Sperm — Small, only DNA. Easy to produce
	
	[[ 🕺🏻 Females don't compete because their product is less replaceable and they invest more into it. Males need to innovate (biologically + sociologically) ]]
	
	Birds dance, bugs give saliva, humans buy stuff
	There exist cases where roles reverse (or seem to reverse):
	- Seahorses — Male is given the egg
	- Cave Insect — Female has penis to take male's sperm. Since sperm is source of water, its a precious resource
	- Spotted Hyena — Female has pseudo-peen protecting from guys, chooses when to retract it
	Sexual Conflict — Generally, Females want to find best males, males want to spread as much as possible. Sexes 'fight' to ensure best outcome for themselves, with occasionally hostile reproductive strategies
	
	
	## Health Experience ##
	
	Human Males and Females have different susceptibilities to diseases
	Different hormone levels and occasionally genes lead to different outcomes of drugs (FDA required female trials by 2014, Research for All Act)
	Pain perception is different. NMDA receptor is needed for morphine, and receptors are different between m/f
	Sex as a Biological Variable (SABV) in 2014. No standards yet, most studies let participants self-report
	No gender variable guidelines either btw. Might potentially be important, should report

	# Evolution #
	
	4 main ways:
	- Natural Selection
	- Genetic Drift
	- Gene Flow
	- Mutation
	
	## Natural Selection 💪 ##
	
	Change in trait frequency due to a change in biological fitness. Requires:
	- Trait must give some sort of fitness advantage
	- Selective Pressure — not everyone can survive
	- Trait must have existing variation (note, means no new mutations allowed, they take longer)
	- Trait must be inheritable
	
	Phenotype — observable characteristic or trait (blood cell shape can be normal or sickled)
	Genes — contain genetic information for traits
	Alleles — alternate versions of a gene that results in a phenotype
	Mutation — random change in genetic information
	
	2021-09-20 →  
	Eu-melanin — black pepo, provides fitness advantage in high UV by... preserving platelets? And stopping cancer
		MCR1 gene is held constant, but variation in others
	Pheo-melanin — white pepo, provides fitness advantage in low UV by helping produce vitamin D, stopping rickets
		MCR1 gene has more variation in European and Asian populations because it's less important
	Skin Pigmentation is poly-genic (controlled by multiple genes)
		MFSD12-A makes eu-melanin (G blocks)
		
	
	[[ ✂️ Evolution doesn't lead to the best solutions ]]
	
	
	## Alleles ##
	
	Dominant allele shows when any exist, while recessive alleles need both alleles to be present (PP&Pp vs pp)
	Most things don't follow dominance rules, because most things are poly-genic, but blood types do
	Monozygote — Has both of dominant or recessive allele
	Heterozygote — Has both dominant and recessive. May be actually most advantageous (sickled cell disease).
	2021-09-22 →  
	Allele frequency changes in new environments — not necessarily mutations
	
	## Mutations ##
	
	Creating a new allele randomly — could be good or bad
	Only mutations in gametes can be passed down
	
	## Genetic Drift ##
	
	Allele frequency change due to chance i.e sampling error — provides no fitness benefit
	Impacts small populations more
	Founder Effect — non-representative subset of individuals separates and migrates to different place
		Gives evidence for African Origin, since Africa has highest genetic variation and hosts an allele superset

[ 🦠 Cells Toggle ]
	
	# Cells #
	
	Organelles — compartments in cell that perform different functions. Bacteria don't have these
	Bacteria — circular chromosome, doesn't have organelles
	Mitochondria — produces ATP inside a cell, might be it's own bacteria stuck inside prokaryotes.
		Has 2 membranes, bacteria-like DNA.
		All of the mitochondria comes from egg, so easier to trace moms
		Sequencing maternal mitochondria DNA supports African lineage (so does sequencing Y chromosome btw)
	Chloroplast — produces ATP with sunlight. Probably bacteria too
	Endosymbiosis — separate organism living inside another. Termites have parabasilid bacteria that break down wood

	## Evidence for Evolution ##
	
	Evolution — change in allele frequency in a population
	Splits in Lineage — Organisms from one side of split cannot reproduce (and produce fertile offspring) with other side of the split.
		Caused by reproductive barrier, i.e: geography
		Two sides might be genetically different
		Defines species
		Internal — change within species, i.e: doesn't fit, behavioral changes
		External — change in environment, i.e: hurricane, river, migrations
	Specie — organisms that can reproduce and produce fertile offspring together
		They arise when they become genetically distinct enough that they can't reproduce with their parent specie
	2021-10-18 →  
	Transitional Fossils — shows intermediary steps between two species in time
	Artificial Selection — natural selection but humans imposing the reproduction preference
	Vestigial Traits — left-over traits from previously functioning structure of ancestor
		Human tailbone or wisdom teeth or (maybe?) appendix
	Homology — molecular or structural similarity between species due to common ancestry
		Anatomical — similar anatomical structure but different functions
		Genetic — mammals share MCR1 gene for pigmentation
		Developmental — similarities in embryonic form between related species that disappear with development
	2021-10-20 →  
	
	## Evolution Artifacts ##
	
	Lobe-finned vs Ray-finned — thick supportive bones in fins that let you walk on a surface vs bendy skin flaps
	Model Organism — used to represent specific parts of human body
		Required: genome sequences, can edit genome, fast generation time, cost efficient, doesn't use space
		Frogs, mice, mustard plants, zebrafish, etc...
	Hox Genes — control expression of hundreds of other developmental genes and determine body plan organization
		Have rigorous order describing placement on the spine — switching them around results in having body parts misplaced on the body
		Alternatively, this lets evolution make 'quick' dramatic changes such as adding more legs. Since these genes usually get duplicated, that clone undergoes genetic drift and eventually comes out as a new body plan

	# Social Evolution and Religion #
	
	Living in a society is fun and beneficial
	Is religion a method of control?
	Health and 'Religiously Active' Correlations — less heart attacks, live longer, more mental health
	ICU Intercession Study
	2021-11-01 →  
	
	## Cheating ##
	
	Clonal Case, where everyone is 100%!g(MISSING)enetically identical
		Cheaters take advantage of others who don't cheat, must be in a group setting
		Cost associated. If alone, might fail or not grow as much. Even in mixed population, overall success is likely harmed
	We can prevent genetic cheating by cooperating only with related individuals
		Amoebas do this too — recognize each other using Allorecognition Receptors to ensure they self-sort
		
	Fixed Cheater — always cheats in every context, but can survive if left alone
	Facultative Coercive Cheater — force other genotypes to increase investment or decrease their own reproduction
	Facultative Self-Promotion Cheater — normal when alone, but cheats in mixed group setting
	Obligate Cheating — social parasitism. Literally cannot survive alone
	
	
	## Cooperation ##
	
	Mutualism — both species gain: 🔺/🔺
		Nemo and Sea Anemonies!
	Predation — predator vs prey: 🔻/🔺
		Also Parasitism
		Cowbirds put their eggs in other birds' nests
	Commensalism — one benefits and other is neutral
	Amensalism — one is neutral but other is hurt
	Interspecies Competition — since resources are limited, both parties are hurt

	# Immunity #
	
	2021-11-03 →  
	Innate Immunity: 
	- Barrier 🛡️: skin, cell membrane, etc.
	- Senses 🔭
	- Communication 📢
	- Destruction 💣
	
	Skin — barrier
	Phlegm, Mucus, Snot — barrier
	
	Cytokines — chemical signaling molecules that stimulate immune response
		Might cause increase temperature, release histamine into mucus, increase immune cell production
	Antigen — stimulates immune response
	Pattern Recognition Receptors — cellular structures for detecting antigens, but cant differentiate between them
	Natural Killer T Cells — digest foreigners
	Macrophage / Neutrofil — encases and digests antigen. Is an:
	
	Adaptive Immune System — exposing actually improves response in the f
	Antigen Presenting Cell — advertising it's recent food so other cells know. Activates B Cell. Immature T cells, when exposed, turn into:
		Mature Helper Cell — stimulates B Cell to produce an antigen
		Mature Cytotoxic
	B Cell — makes antibodies specific to an antigen. Requires double activation by ATPC and Mature Helper Cells. Gets saved after infection
	Antibody — protein targeting specific other protein
		Cover virus spikes
		Blows up infected cells
		Has familiar interface that marks connected cell for destruction
	
	2021-11-10 →  
	
	### Viruses ###
	
	Non-cellular life? Or just not life at all?
	Spike — attaches to a specific species of host cell
	Capsid — protect the viral genome. Can look pretty different (helical, lipid membrane, polyhedral)
	
	Antigen tests seek to attach antibodies that are more detectable to whatever viral load exists
	PCR tests seeks to add primers that will bind to antigen and multiply it to make it more detectable
	
	
	## Genetic Code ##
	
	4 nucleotide types: ATCG
	Codon — 3 nucleotide combo
		Some codons map to same things
	We have 21 words → 20 Amino Acids
	
	## Virus Variants ##
	
	2021-11-29 →  
	Zoonotic Reservoirs — animals that hold and support virus populations but don't get sick
