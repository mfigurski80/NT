# Scientific Method

//![to_do]
Observation🔭 → Question❓ → Hypothesis❗ → Experiment🧪 → Results📰 → Conclusion😍 → <restart or done>



Any experiment needs:

//![bulleted_list_item]
//![bulleted_list_item]
//![bulleted_list_item]
//![bulleted_list_item]
After going through an experiment, do some stat! to see if difference is significant



Reporting publishes methods, results, conclusions, and then undergoes peer review:

//![callout]
Consensus: collective agreement of majority of scientists in a particular field of study

Furthermore, scientists are very poorly connected with the public, who mostly get their understanding from the media or policymakers (think pop sci, etc). Like here: https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/significant.png

[ ⚧️ Biological Sex and Gender Toggle ]

2021-09-01 →  

## Biological Sex and Gender

Sex is Biological, determined by chromosomes, physical, physiological characteristics

Gender recently refers to sociological things, and Gender Identity is how you perceive yourself in relation to sociological things

### Cell Theory

All have 4 basic features:

//![numbered_list_item]
//![numbered_list_item]
//![numbered_list_item]
### Human Development

Unicellular cells reproduce asexually through cell division, producing exact clones.

Sexual reproduction uses gametes: sperm + egg = zygote → embryo. Still need to use cell division, but differentiate genetic information.

Humans have chromosomes, 1-22 (autosomes, not sexual), and two 1 chromosomes (sexual). XX → Female, XY → Male. Females get 1 X deactivated (visible Barr Body dot in cells), and no SRY gene because no Y chromosome, and so WNT4 turned on.

Before 6 weeks, has BOTH m/f set of structures. After, one set degenerates, and other develops into primary sex characteristic (genitalia).

Testosterone → ♂️, and Estrogen → ♀️



Puberty: secondary sex characteristics

Depends on sex hormone concentration, not needed for reproduction.

Sexual Dimorphism — differences in size or appearance between sexes

Argument for defining sex as binary (Wright), or Quinn (spectrum)

## Determination in Nature

Sex deciding process can fail at many levels:

//![bulleted_list_item]
//![bulleted_list_item]
Sex can be fluid, determined in different ways by different species. Plants are often hermaphroditic — make pollen and seeds, make female and male flower

Some species can turn on / off genes like DMRT1 and FOXL2 (common to vertebrates) to change genders

## Sex Roles in Nature

Eggs — Big cells, 300-400 over lifetime. Invests more in the gamete. "Nutritious" ~ Prof Nam

Sperm — Small, only DNA. Easy to produce

//![callout]
Birds dance, bugs give saliva, humans buy stuff

There exist cases where roles reverse (or seem to reverse):

//![bulleted_list_item]
//![bulleted_list_item]
//![bulleted_list_item]
Sexual Conflict — Generally, Females want to find best males, males want to spread as much as possible. Sexes 'fight' to ensure best outcome for themselves, with occasionally hostile reproductive strategies



## Health Experience

Human Males and Females have different susceptibilities to diseases

Different hormone levels and occasionally genes lead to different outcomes of drugs (FDA required female trials by 2014, Research for All Act)

Pain perception is different. NMDA receptor is needed for morphine, and receptors are different between m/f

Sex as a Biological Variable (SABV) in 2014. No standards yet, most studies let participants self-report

No gender variable guidelines either btw. Might potentially be important, should report

# Evolution

4 main ways:

//![numbered_list_item]
//![numbered_list_item]
//![numbered_list_item]
//![numbered_list_item]
## Natural Selection 💪

Change in trait frequency due to a change in biological fitness. Requires:

//![numbered_list_item]
//![numbered_list_item]
//![numbered_list_item]
//![numbered_list_item]


Phenotype — observable characteristic or trait (blood cell shape can be normal or sickled)

Genes — contain genetic information for traits

Alleles — alternate versions of a gene that results in a phenotype

Mutation — random change in genetic information



2021-09-20 →  

Eu-melanin — black pepo, provides fitness advantage in high UV by... preserving platelets? And stopping cancer
MCR1 gene is held constant, but variation in others


Pheo-melanin — white pepo, provides fitness advantage in low UV by helping produce vitamin D, stopping rickets
MCR1 gene has more variation in European and Asian populations because it's less important


Skin Pigmentation is poly-genic (controlled by multiple genes)
MFSD12-A makes eu-melanin (G blocks)




//![callout]
## Alleles

Dominant allele shows when any exist, while recessive alleles need both alleles to be present (PP&Pp vs pp)

Most things don't follow dominance rules, because most things are poly-genic, but blood types do

Monozygote — Has both of dominant or recessive allele

Heterozygote — Has both dominant and recessive. May be actually most advantageous (sickled cell disease).

2021-09-22 →  

Allele frequency changes in new environments — not necessarily mutations

## Mutations

Creating a new allele randomly — could be good or bad

Only mutations in gametes can be passed down

## Genetic Drift

Allele frequency change due to chance i.e sampling error — provides no fitness benefit

Impacts small populations more

Founder Effect — non-representative subset of individuals separates and migrates to different place
Gives evidence for African Origin, since Africa has highest genetic variation and hosts an allele superset

[ 🦠 Cells Toggle ]

# Cells

Organelles — compartments in cell that perform different functions. Bacteria don't have these

Bacteria — circular chromosome, doesn't have organelles

Mitochondria — produces ATP inside a cell, might be it's own bacteria stuck inside prokaryotes.
Has 2 membranes, bacteria-like DNA.

All of the mitochondria comes from egg, so easier to trace moms

Sequencing maternal mitochondria DNA supports African lineage (so does sequencing Y chromosome btw)


Chloroplast — produces ATP with sunlight. Probably bacteria too

Endosymbiosis — separate organism living inside another. Termites have parabasilid bacteria that break down wood

[ 🐦 Evidence for Evolution Toggle ]

2021-10-06 →  

## Evidence for Evolution

Evolution — change in allele frequency in a population

Splits in Lineage — Organisms from one side of split cannot reproduce (and produce fertile offspring) with other side of the split.
Caused by reproductive barrier, i.e: geography

Two sides might be genetically different

Defines species

Internal — change within species, i.e: doesn't fit, behavioral changes

External — change in environment, i.e: hurricane, river, migrations


Specie — organisms that can reproduce and produce fertile offspring together
They arise when they become genetically distinct enough that they can't reproduce with their parent specie


2021-10-18 →  

Transitional Fossils — shows intermediary steps between two species in time

Artificial Selection — natural selection but humans imposing the reproduction preference

Vestigial Traits — left-over traits from previously functioning structure of ancestor
Human tailbone or wisdom teeth or (maybe?) appendix


Homology — molecular or structural similarity between species due to common ancestry
Anatomical — similar anatomical structure but different functions

Genetic — mammals share MCR1 gene for pigmentation

Developmental — similarities in embryonic form between related species that disappear with development


2021-10-20 →  

## Evolution Artifacts

Lobe-finned vs Ray-finned — thick supportive bones in fins that let you walk on a surface vs bendy skin flaps

Model Organism — used to represent specific parts of human body
Required: genome sequences, can edit genome, fast generation time, cost efficient, doesn't use space

Frogs, mice, mustard plants, zebrafish, etc...


Hox Genes — control expression of hundreds of other developmental genes and determine body plan organization
Have rigorous order describing placement on the spine — switching them around results in having body parts misplaced on the body

Alternatively, this lets evolution make 'quick' dramatic changes such as adding more legs. Since these genes usually get duplicated, that clone undergoes genetic drift and eventually comes out as a new body plan

# Social Evolution and Religion

Living in a society is fun and beneficial

Is religion a method of control?

Health and 'Religiously Active' Correlations — less heart attacks, live longer, more mental health

ICU Intercession Study

## Cheating

Clonal Case, where everyone is 100%!g(MISSING)enetically identical
Cheaters take advantage of others who don't cheat, must be in a group setting

Cost associated. If alone, might fail or not grow as much. Even in mixed population, overall success is likely harmed


We can prevent genetic cheating by cooperating only with related individuals
Amoebas do this too — recognize each other using Allorecognition Receptors to ensure they self-sort




Fixed Cheater — always cheats in every context, but can survive if left alone

Facultative Coercive Cheater — force other genotypes to increase investment or decrease their own reproduction

Facultative Self-Promotion Cheater — normal when alone, but cheats in mixed group setting

Obligate Cheating — social parasitism. Literally cannot survive alone



## Cooperation

Mutualism — both species gain: 🔺/🔺
Nemo and Sea Anemonies!


Predation — predator vs prey: 🔻/🔺
Also Parasitism

Cowbirds put their eggs in other birds' nests


Commensalism — one benefits and other is neutral

Amensalism — one is neutral but other is hurt

Interspecies Competition — since resources are limited, both parties are hurt

Innate Immunity: 

//![numbered_list_item]
//![numbered_list_item]
//![numbered_list_item]
//![numbered_list_item]


Skin — barrier

Phlegm, Mucus, Snot — barrier



Cytokines — chemical signaling molecules that stimulate immune response
Might cause increase temperature, release histamine into mucus, increase immune cell production


Antigen — stimulates immune response

Pattern Recognition Receptors — cellular structures for detecting antigens, but cant differentiate between them

Natural Killer T Cells — digest foreigners

Macrophage / Neutrofil — encases and digests antigen. Is an:



Adaptive Immune System — exposing actually improves response in the f

Antigen Presenting Cell — advertising it's recent food so other cells know. Activates B Cell. Immature T cells, when exposed, turn into:
Mature Helper Cell — stimulates B Cell to produce an antigen

Mature Cytotoxic


B Cell — makes antibodies specific to an antigen. Requires double activation by ATPC and Mature Helper Cells. Gets saved after infection

Antibody — protein targeting specific other protein
Cover virus spikes

Blows up infected cells

Has familiar interface that marks connected cell for destruction




2021-11-10 →  

### Viruses

Non-cellular life? Or just not life at all?

Spike — attaches to a specific species of host cell

Capsid — protect the viral genome. Can look pretty different (helical, lipid membrane, polyhedral)



Antigen tests seek to attach antibodies that are more detectable to whatever viral load exists

PCR tests seeks to add primers that will bind to antigen and multiply it to make it more detectable



## Genetic Code

4 nucleotide types: ATCG

Codon — 3 nucleotide combo
Some codons map to same things


We have 21 words → 20 Amino Acids

## Virus Variants

2021-11-29 →  

Zoonotic Reservoirs — animals that hold and support virus populations but don't get sick
